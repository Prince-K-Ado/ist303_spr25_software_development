## Check-ins

Flask assignment

From HN:
[Think Python, 3rd Ed](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/)


---
## Lubanovic Chapter 12: Wrangle and Mangle Data

Strings represented in python as unicode sequences (not byte arrays)

What is [unicode](https://home.unicode.org/)?
- a standard that assigns a unique number to each character used in written languages
- currently has over 149K characters
- ASCII is always the first 128 characters (to remain backwards compatible)

---
## Brief Detour: Text Encoding Standards
- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
  - 128 unique values (string.ascii_lowercase, punctuation, #'s)
  - one of the original character encoding systems (1963)
  - each character fits in one byte (all chars stored in 7 bits)
- [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
  - implementation of unicode, handles all 1 million+ unicode values
  - variable length (1-4 bytes) - smaller values stored with fewer bytes
  - preferred choice for encoding

---
## Text Encoding Standards, cont'd
- Latin-1, cp-1252 (windows latin char encoding scheme)
  - extension of ASCII - uses all 8 bits allowing up to 256 characters
  - no longer used for encoding (replaced by UTF-8)
  - western alphabet

---
## Encoding and Decoding?
Unicode is the _standard_ - an agreed upon mapping of codes to characters

Encoding and decoding relate to the implementation of a standard (i.e. UTF-8)

**Encoding** implements character code conversion to binary (storage of characters in bytes)

**Decoding** translates bytes to character codes

---
## Unicode planes
- unicode divided into [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode))
  - logical groupings of characters
  - each plane has 66,536 possible values
- Plane 0 is the basic multilingual plane, or BMP
  - contains all chars for most modern languages
  - The first section of Plane 0 is ascii (128 chars, 7 bits, or 2^7 = 128 values)

---
![bg 85%](rsc/unicode_planes.png)

---
## Python characters and unicode values
`import unicodedata`
- `'\u007a'` == `'\u007A'` == `'\U0000007A'` (backwards compatibility)
- Uses hexadecimal characters (16 values: 0-9, A-F)
  - base char set (plane 0) accessed with `\u` (lowercase u) followed by 4 hex chars: '\u0031'
  - extended char sets (all other planes) accessed with `\U` (uppercase U) and 8 hex chars: '\U0001F334'
- hopefully you don't '\U0001F634' in class

---
## String characters to bytes
bytes are represented as decimal integers (0 to 255)

convert characters to bytes (object type 'bytes') using:
- The encode string method: 
`'sasquatch'.encode('utf-8')`
- The bytes function (immutable): 
`bytes('sasquatch', 'utf-8')` 

can convert to a bytearray object (mutable) using:
`bytearray('sasquatch', 'utf-8')`

---
### String characters to bytes example
```
s = 'sasquatch'
b = bytes(s, 'utf-8')  #convert using bytes function

slist = [x for x in s] #char list
blist = [x for x in b] #byte list

d = dict(zip(slist, blist))

print(d)
```

_Note that the zip function returns an object of type 'zip'. The 'dict' function natively supports creation from zip objects. To convert to a list you would need a list comprehension, L = [x for x in zip(slist, blist)]_

---
## Decimal to unicode character: `chr()` function
Unicode characters have both a hexadecimal (reviewed earlier) and decimal representation
- Hex looked like: '\u0023'

You can move from **decimal** value to **string** character using the chr() function, passing in the decimal value as a parameter:

```
chr(83)
chr(115)  #illustrates the upper/lower sorting in the homework
```

---
## Recap
- how Python represents characters using hex values
  - '\u00FF'
  - '\U000000FF'
- how to go from string characters to bytes
  - string encode() method
  - bytes, bytearray functions
- how to get string character from integer value:  chr()

---
## Hex to Decimal
What if you have a hex value and you want to get the decimal (integer) value?

- what is the integer value of '\U0002EBE0'?

---
![bg 90%](rsc/hex_dec_conversion.png)

---
### What can we say about the hex value '\U0002EBE0'?

- what plane is it on?
- we now know the decimal value is 191,456
- can see the value by using the chr() function:
`chr(191456)`
- try viewing the unicode character one integer value higher



---
![](rsc/hex_dec_emoji2.png)

You don't have to convert manually, can use the int function:
int(str, base): `int('0001F634', 16)`

---
## Hex and Decimal comparison

Compare the value of the python unicode hex value with the converted integer value (using the chr function):
```
'\U0001F634' == chr(128564)
```



---

## Displaying unicode characters in python
- python returns the text as a string for unassigned hex codes
- returns question mark inside a box if font does not support the character

```
'\U0002EBE0' # supported by my terminal
'\U0002EBE1' # not assigned
'\U0001FB35' # not supported by my terminal
```

---
## What does that have to do with software development?
- understand that there are different encoding schemes
- if you ingest/read external data you may need to deal with different encoding to make use of the data
- your program may feed into others that require a particular encoding
- especially important when dealing with binary
- can extend the same logic to images (many more file extensions/formats to deal with there)

---
### Regular expressions
Regular expressions are a pseudo language for matching patterns in strings. 
- their own language, beyond python
- difficult to read
- powerful string search/matching functionality

---
### Regex in python
_re_ module in the standard Python library

Import with `import re` 

---
### Re functions
- `re.search(pattern, string)`
  - returns a match object if the pattern is found in the string, otherwise returns None
  - access match object with `.group(0)`, i.e. `re.search(pattern, string).group(0)`
- `re.findall(pattern, string)`
  - returns a list of all matches in the string
- `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`
  - returns a string with all instances of the pattern replaced with the replacement string

---
### Example: Regex + string methods
In regex, 
  - [fg] returns matches for f or g
  - the + symbol returns 1 or more matches

The following regex statement equates to _'find one or more instances of any of the following characters that appear inside the brackets'_:
```
"[aeiohnpsty]+"
```

---
#### Example: coded message
for reference: `"[aeiohnpsty]+"`
1. import the re module: `import re`
2. assign the variable _coded_msg_ as shown below: \
`coded_msg = "cup fly turf hour nick seas dry"`
3. use **re.findall(pattern, string)** to return a list of _coded_msg_ characters that match the regex statement shown above step 1. Assign the result to a variable named `msg`
4. re.findall() returns a list. Use the string join() method to concatenate the `msg` list variable into a string (_hint: recall you can use an empty string `''` as the object of the join method_)

# **Lubanovic Chapter 14: Files and Directories**
![bg](rsc/xfiles.jpg)

---
## Writing to files
Seen previously how to do this in terminal:

- echo "sometext" > file.txt
- touch file1.txt    # mac/linux only
- new-item file1.txt # powershell only

---
## When writing code to access files, will need a way in Python to do so

Terminal commands from before will not be useful

---
## Python open() function
open and edit files from within Python scripts (or interactive session)

Need to open a file to:
- read from it
- create it
- add to it or overwrite existing contents

format: `fil = open(FILENAME, MODE)`
_where mode is a string value_

---
## Mode Argument (2nd arg in open() function)
supports up to two characters: 
![](rsc/open_mode.png)

---
## Open example - reading a file
Open a connection to a file, read it, and close the connection:
```
file = open('file.txt', 'rt') # manually open, r=read, t=text
data = file.read()
file.close() # manually close
```

This will load all the contents of the file all at once into the _data_ variable

---
## Writing files
write() method of file objects:
```
filobj = open('test.txt', 'wt') # create text file in overwrite mode
filobj.write("This is the first line")
filobj.close()
```
append to the file:
```
filobj = open('test.txt', 'at', encoding = "utf-8")
filobj.write('\n\U0001F634')
filobj.close()
```

---
## Use the "With" statement to open files
Using "open" within a with statement automatically closes a file when the block of code is exited.
- don't need file.close() - eliminates resource leaks, code more readable
- error handling - with statement ensures that the file is closed properly if it encounters an error (could remain open with an error in the manua method)
```
with open('somefile.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
```

---
## Getting contents of a file as a variable:
## Slurp with **read()**

Get all contents (in memory) at once, using **read** (returns a single string object):
```
with open('test.txt', 'rt', encoding = 'utf-8') as fil:
  data = fil.read()
```
---
## Getting contents of a file as a variable:
## Iterate over a line with **readline()**

```
data = ''
with open('test.txt', 'rt', encoding = 'utf-8') as fil:
  for i in range(4):  # range extends past file length    
    data += fil.readline()
```

---
## Getting contents of a file as a variable:
## Create a list of lines with **readlines()**
Using **readlines()**
```
with open('test.txt', 'rt', encoding = 'utf-8') as fil:
  data = fil.readlines()
```
readlines reads one line at a time, appending each line into a list of strings

---
## Getting contents of a file as a variable:
## **Roll your own**

Iterate over the lines in the file (concat as a string in this ex):
```
data = ''
with open('test.txt', 'rt', encoding = 'utf-8') as fil:
  for line in fil:
    data += line
```
Could create any data type, add criteria for creating your data, etc.

---
## Other file operations
Check if a file exists: `os.path.exists('path')`
```
import os
os.path.exists('test.txt')
```

Check if something is a file: `os.path.isfile()`
```
os.path.isfile('test.txt')
```

Can also check if something is a directory with `os.path.isdir()`

---
# Other file operations, cont'd
Copy files
```
import shutil
shutil.copy('test.txt', 'testcopy.txt')
```

Rename files
```
import os
os.rename('testcopy.txt', 'im_a_new_name.txt')
```

---
## Search directory for files
Glob module

Similar to regular expression matching, but much simpler syntax and ruleset. ! is 'not' operator, ? matches any single character.

match any file in the directory:
`import glob`
`glob.glob('*')`

match filenames containing a 't': `glob.glob('*t*')`
match filenames containing 'tr' or 'te': `glob.glob('*t[er]*')`


---
# Lubanovic Ch. 16: Data in a box - persistent storage

---
## Delimited files
csv (comma separated values)
- come in other flavors, i.e. tab delimited ('\t'), '|' delimited
- first row may have column headers
- values in a 'field' may contain escape characters; can be dealt with either with outer enclosure in quotes, or escape characters

python has a csv module
`import csv`

---
## Create a file

ken.py

---
## Read the file
read the file with **csv.reader()**:
```
with open('kenblogs', 'rt') as fil:
  c = csv.reader(fil)
  kenblogs = [row for row in c]
```
read the file with **csv.DictReader()**:
```
with open('kenblogs', 'rt') as fil:
  c = csv.DictReader(fil, fieldnames=['first', 'last', 'postids'])
  kenblogs = [row for row in c]
```
---
## Object persistence
Saw how to read/write to delimited, text files. 

What if you want to store your objects directly, not as text?

---
## Writing objects to files, and back again
Shelve library (extends the pickle library)
- Stores objects directly, re-imported as objects
- don't have to worry how data will import (lists, strings, etc)
- quick way to persist objects

Drawbacks:
- security risk of executing arbitrary code
- not a database replacement 

---
## Shelve example
Shelve for later:
```
d = {"name":"not Ken", "posts":[23,34]}
import shelve
with shelve.open('myshelf') as db:
  db['myobj'] = d   #write object 'd' to 'myshelf' file
```
Delete, then retrieve the object from file
```
del d #delete the d object
with shelve.open('myshelf') as db:
  d = db['myobj']
```

---
## Other data organization schemas
The book touches briefly on dynamically structured documents (no predefined schema other than formatting rules):
- XML
- JSON
- YAML

There are Python libraries to manage interaction with all these document formats

---
## Data science / transformation / processing
Pandas library
- for ingesting and manipulating data
- similar to the R programming language
- heavy focus on vectorized operations
- more functional approach to programming 

---
## We saw how to
- write object contents to text files
- store objects directly

what about communicating with databases?

---
# Connecting to Relational Databases
Python has a standard API for accessing relational databases, DB-API. Contains the following abstractions to operate regardless of your db choice:
- **connect()**: connect to a database (create if doesn't exist)
- **cursor()**: create a cursor object to execute queries (created from connection object like connection.cursor())
- **execute()** and executemany(): execute SQL commands against the database (executed from cursor object, cursor.execute())
- manage result set: **fetchall()**, **fetchmany()**, **fetchone()**

---
## SQLite
DB-API extended/used by the various relational database libraries
**sqlite** used in the Flask part 3 exercise

Saw this two ways in the assignment:
- creating a connection and then using 'with open' to execute a database creation script (schema.sql script) 
- creating a connection function and using it to create a cursor to execute relevant database CRUD operations based on user actions (create, read, update, delete)

---
#### Running a table creation script (init_db.py file)
```
import sqlite

connection = sqlite3.connect('database.db')

with open('schema.sql') as f:
  connection.executescript(f.read())

cur = connection.cursor()

cur.execute("INSERT INTO posts (title, content) VALUES (?, ?)",
            ('First Post', 'Content for the first post')
            )

connection.commit() 
connection.close()
```

---
## Cursor and SQL query format
```
cur = connection.cursor()

cur.execute("INSERT INTO posts (title, content) VALUES (?, ?)",
            ('First Post', 'Content for the first post')
            )
```
- commit needed with CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (edit commands)
- Sql statement is a single string
- (title, content) are the column names (defined in the schema file)
- the (?, ?) within the query are values not yet known, defined as a tuple immediately after to avoid sql injection attacks

---
## CRUD: read
```
import sqlite
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row

posts = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM posts').fetchall()
conn.close()
```

- no commit
- conn.row_factory creates customizable cursor, in this case sqlite3.row creates a dictionary cursor (key access instead of offset)
- default cursor returns each row as a tuple

---
## CRUD: update
```
import sqlite
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row


conn.execute('UPDATE posts SET title = ?, content = ?'
            ' WHERE id = ?',
            (title, content, id))
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

---
## CRUD: delete
```
import sqlite
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row


conn.execute('DELETE FROM posts WHERE id = ?', (id,))
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

---
## Other SQL flavors in Python
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

SQLAlchemy: 
- extends DB-API, allows connections to the various flavors of SQL
- Works at a layer of abstraction higher than the other sql libraries
- has an ORM (Object relational model) that tightly integrates application code and relational data structures

---
ORM provides the plumbing to connect these two houses:

### Document and Object storage
Document databases
- Various NoSQL databases (pp 340-341 in Lubanovic)

Object-oriented databases - like document store, but for objects
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/databases/what-is-an-object-oriented-database)

# Design Patterns
"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (1994)
![bg right:50%](rsc/gof.jpg)

Erich Gamma, 
Richard Helm, 
Ralph Johnson, 
John Vlissides


---
## GoF: Types of patterns
- **Creational**: patterns that create objects, rather than instantiating directly. Control which and how objects are created.
- **Structural**: class and object composition. Use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
- **Behavioral**: how objects behave, primarily related to communication between objects.

[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

---
##  GoF Examples

_Creational_: **Builder** pattern to separate construction and representation

_Structural_: **Decorator** pattern to dynamically override behavior in an existing method of an object (pytest, flask routes, etc.)

_Behavioral_: **Observer** pattern to implement publish/subscribe functionality, where any # of observer objects can see an event

---
builder pattern example

separation of construction and representation

[builder.py](test_dir/builder.py)

---
## Decorator pattern
- flask routes
- pytest markers

---
## Observer pattern
implement publish/subscribe functionality, where any # of observer objects can see an event

## Architectural Digest: MVC
Model: data required to be displayed in the View. Collection of classes that describes the business logic (business model and the data model). The code that "does stuff"

View: UI components (HTML, CSS, etc.); displays data received from controller

Controller: processes incoming requests. Sends user data to Model, passes results to View

![](rsc/mvc_summation.png)

---
## MVC 
What does this architectural pattern have in common with many design & architectural patterns?

- separation of responsibility
- logical organization of codebase into parts that can be independently worked on, do not require changes to each other (or minimal)
- Changes to your business logic should only affect one area of your codebase (in this case the models)

## Additional design considerations
SOLID design principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

---
## SRP - we've seen this before
- Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change; it has only one job or responsibility.

---
## Open-closed
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be:
- open for extension
- closed for modification
- the result is that you can add new functionality without changing the existing code

---
## Liskov Substitution Principle
Functions that use base/parent classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without having it alter the behavior of the program
- if you overwrite a function in a subclass it must accept data that the parent class would so that it is indistinguishable
- superclass objects can be replaced with subclass objects and function properly without undesired effects
- derived classes only extend (see open-close principle)

---
## Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use
- a class or module should not depend on methods or properties it doesn’t need
- split software into multiple, independent parts 

---
## Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions

- decouple high-level and low-level modules
- they both depend on the same abstraction/interface
- editing low-level modules should not necessitate changes to high-level modules


---
## SOLID
Seeks to:
- provide a way to decouple software modules in an effective way
- make software easier to understand, maintain, and extend
